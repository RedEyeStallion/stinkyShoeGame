# stinkyShoeGame

StinkyShoe Clicker is a school team project in which we created a simple clicker game! The player must continually click on the shoe
in the center of the screen to gain points. Once enough points are accumulated, you can hit the upgrade button to increase the amount
of points gained for each click. But be careful, you may randomly enter the muddy or stinky event, where you must grab a towel or
spraycan in order to clean your shoe quick! While your shoe is dirty, your points decrease dramatically. Have fun!
